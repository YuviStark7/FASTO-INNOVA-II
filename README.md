# Fasto Innova

An AI marketplace prototype that helps small farmers around **Cassino** (Lazio, Italy) sell directly to nearby buyers — restaurants, hotels, shops and local channels — without forms or spreadsheets. Built for an R&S Management internship project.

Visual design is a direct implementation of the Figma file *DOLCE MERAVGLIA* (Dashboard / Clients / Fasto-AI frames): dark red glass panels over a full-bleed farm photo, Roboto type.

## The three brains

1. **Brain 1 — Interviewer.** A conversational AI that chats with the farmer in plain language (Italian or English) and gathers what they grow, how much, when, and where.
2. **Brain 2 — Matchmaker.** A deterministic scoring engine that ranks the farmer against a curated database of 36 real Cassino-area buyers + 3 sales channels, then an AI writer drafts the pitch and one outreach message.
3. **Brain 3 — Guardian.** Validates and sanity-checks everything moving between Brain 1 and Brain 2: blocks prompt-injection attempts, flags personal data, rejects buyers the AI didn't actually retrieve, and catches false claims (e.g. "organic" when the farmer isn't certified). It runs on every message — there's no dedicated log screen in this design, but every check is logged to the browser console (`F12` → Console) if you want to see it live.

## Screens

- **Dashboard** — Research Progress table: your last conversations, targeted product, quantity pledged, an assumed price per kg (click it to adjust), and how far each one has progressed.
- **Clients** — every buyer Brain 2 has matched you with, and the real outreach message Brain 2 drafted for them (Italian + English). Nothing here is simulated — a message only appears once a real match has been found. "Mark as sent" and "Copy" are manual, on purpose: this prototype never sends anything on its own.
- **Fasto-AI** — the interview itself, with a history rail on the right so you can start fresh chats or revisit old ones.
- **Admin** (R&S account only) — a funnel showing where conversations stop (started → farm profile captured → buyers matched and a draft written → outreach sent), over a table of every conversation across the whole app. Click a funnel stage to filter the table to it. Every bar counts *conversations*, never drafts: one finished conversation produces a draft per matched buyer, so mixing the two would show more at the bottom of the funnel than at the top. The draft totals are given separately, beside it.

## Italiano or English

There is an **IT / EN** switch on the sign-in card and, once you are inside, in the top bar on the right — the same place on a phone, where the sidebar shrinks to a row of icons.

The app opens in whatever language your browser is set to (Italian phone → Italian) and remembers your choice on that device afterwards. It is a display preference and nothing more: switching never writes anything to your account, and never changes a product category, an organic status or a chat title that has already been saved.

Two things stay put on purpose. Brain 2's written notes and its **outreach draft** are left exactly as they were composed — the draft is deliberately an Italian message plus an English translation, and it is the one thing a real buyer ever reads. And the logistics request emailed to the partner keeps its English field names, because that partner receives requests from every farmer and one inbox should not change language per sender; it carries a line naming the farmer's language instead, so they know how to reply. In the offline demo the scripted conversation *does* follow the switch, because that is Fasto standing in for Brain 1, which always mirrors the language you write in.

## Running it

No install, no build step — it's plain HTML/CSS/JS.

1. Download/open this folder.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or host it, see below).
3. **Sign in or sign up** with an email + password — this is what saves your chats, matches and outreach drafts between visits. Accounts are handled by Supabase; farmers each see only their own data.
4. On the next screen, choose:
   - **Offline demo** — works instantly, no key needed. Runs a scripted example conversation (a tomato & zucchine farmer near Sant'Elia Fiumerapido) end-to-end.
   - **Live AI** — paste your own Anthropic API key (get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)). A full run costs a few cents. The key is only ever stored in your own browser (`localStorage`, optional) — it is never written to a file and never leaves your machine except to call Anthropic's API directly.

   Either way, once you're signed in, everything you do is saved to your account automatically — no separate "save" step.

## Your account & data

Farmer accounts, chats, messages, matches and outreach drafts are stored in a Supabase project (Postgres + built-in auth), locked down with Row Level Security so each farmer can only ever see their own rows. Buyers don't get accounts — the buyer database stays a curated, read-only dataset fetched live from the same project. The `SUPABASE_URL`/publishable key visible in `js/supabase-client.js` are meant to be public (that's how Supabase's security model works — the database itself is the lock, not the key), so it's safe that they're committed to this repo, same as the rest of the code.

There's also a private **Admin** view (visible only on the R&S account) showing every farmer's activity across the whole app — it stays hidden for everyone else.

## Hosting it for free (so anyone with the link can open it — e.g. on a phone)

**GitHub Pages, no terminal needed:**

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) → sign in (or create a free account) → **New repository**. Name it e.g. `fasto-innova`, keep it **Public**, don't add a README (you already have one).
2. On the new repo's page, click **uploading an existing file**.
3. Drag in every file and folder from this project (`index.html`, `manifest.json`, `css/`, `js/`, `assets/`, this `README.md`) and click **Commit changes**.
4. Go to the repo's **Settings → Pages**. Under "Build and deployment", set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, branch **main**, folder **/ (root)**. Save.
5. Wait ~1 minute, then your app is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/fasto-innova/` — open that on any phone or laptop.

No terminal, no git commands — everything above is point-and-click on github.com.

**One follow-up once it's live:** Supabase's "confirm your email" link redirects new sign-ups back to a URL set in the Supabase dashboard, which currently isn't your GitHub Pages address. Signup still works either way — the account gets confirmed regardless — but to make that link land back on the app instead of a blank/wrong page, go to your Supabase project → **Authentication → URL Configuration** and set **Site URL** to `https://<your-username>.github.io/fasto-innova/` once you know it (one field, one save — no code involved).

## Project structure

```
index.html          app shell — onboarding + sidebar/header + the 3 screens
css/base.css         design tokens, resets, buttons/pills/inputs/avatars
css/app.css           shell layout, dashboard/clients/chatbot layouts, mobile
js/i18n.js             the IT/EN dictionary + T() — every visible string in the app
js/data.js              the 36-buyer + 3-channel Cassino database, price assumptions
js/core.js               Brain 2 (matching engine) + Brain 3 (Guardian) — pure functions, unit-tested
js/app.js                 state, screens, Brain 1 orchestration (Claude API calls)
js/supabase-client.js      accounts + database access (DataStore) — the only file that talks to Supabase
assets/                     images/icons exported from the Figma file
manifest.json                PWA metadata (name, theme color)
test_engine.js                dev only — the matching engine (19 tests)
test_data_layer.js             dev only — app ↔ database, and the language layer (203 tests)
qa_check.js                     dev only — static checks: assets, dead handlers, syntax, translations
```

## Checking nothing broke

Three scripts, none of which ship with the app or need anything installed — plain `node`, no `npm install`, no internet, and none of them touch the real database:

```
node test_engine.js        →  19 passed, 0 failed
node test_data_layer.js    →  203 passed, 0 failed
node qa_check.js           →  QA: PASS
```

Run all three from inside this folder after any change. The daily improvement automation (see `ROADMAP.md`) refuses to ship anything unless they all come back clean.

## Data honesty

The buyer database (`js/data.js`) is desk research from public listings (review sites, business directories, official sites) — real business names and locations, but `needs`, `volume` and `quality_focus` are inferred for prototype purposes and would need real outreach to confirm before commercial use. This is documented directly in `data.js`'s `meta.disclaimer` field. Per-kg prices shown on the dashboard are editable assumptions, not live market data — click any price to change it.
